# Class Map_data_adapter: 
Is a subclass of Map_place_provider and serves as a data adapter for map places. Here is an overview of the class:

### Attributes:

    places: A list that stores the map places.
    sent_places: A set that keeps track of the places that have been sent.

### Methods:

    __init__(self, backend_module): The constructor method for the Map_data_adapter class. It initializes the places list and sent_places set. It also calls the superclass constructor Map_place_provider with the provided backend_module.
    postprocessing(self): A method for post-processing the map data. It calls the download_places() method and retrieves the raw places using the get_places_raw() method.
    test_favorite_processing(self): A placeholder method for processing favorite places (not implemented in the code snippet).
    get_places_unique(self): Retrieves the unique places from the places list. It filters out the places that have already been sent and updates the sent_places set accordingly.
    get_places(self): Returns the places list.
    set_places_data(self): A placeholder method for setting the places data (not implemented in the code snippet).

### Attributes:

    places_raw: A list that stores the raw map places.
    map_info: A dictionary for storing map information.
    date: A string representing the date.
    data_status: An integer representing the status of the data.
    timer: An integer representing the timer value.
    receiving_time: A list for storing receiving times.

    get_data_status(self): Returns the data status.
    get_date(self): Returns the date.
    get_timer(self): Returns the timer value.
    set_places(self): Sets the places.
    set_map_info(self): Sets the map information.
    set_data_status(self): Sets the data status.
    set_date(self): Sets the date.
    set_timer(self): Sets the timer.
